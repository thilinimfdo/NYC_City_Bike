## Objective of the Analysis

The core objective of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal by analysing the length of the time that bikes are checked out, the number of bike trips.

### Length of Time

It seems like the majority of the bikers are not renting them out for less than one hour.

### Number of Bike Trips

Based on the analysis there is a spike in the morning 8am-9am and then again 4:30pm-6pm across all five days except Wednesday. This pattern clearly says that these renting are for commuting for work. And then clearly this is more popular among men compared to Women.

This is further confirmed by the following image as well.

## Summary

There is clear indication that male population is using the bikes for daily commuting for work which is a very strong indication that this project is viable. If we can connect the retning time/places then we can also find popular destitations and orgins to setup proper bike outlets.
